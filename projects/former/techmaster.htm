<p>This one is interesting. It's a YouTube channel i started back in 2019 focused on Android. I took a year-long hiatus on the channel, but i came back with videos of both the Android 1.6 Clock an Calculator working on Android 8.1. I took another break, but i came back with footage of the 1.6 E-Mail app not letting me sign in to my email. It's on the trash can, right next to that notebook used in one of its videos.</p>
